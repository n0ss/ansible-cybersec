# ansible-cybersec

This repository was created to provide ansible configurations files to automatically bootstrap and deploy Debian-based systems with penetration testing/CTF/cyber-security capabilities. On the opposite of Kali Linux, or Parrot OS Security, the goal of these updated systems is to be stable, come with a minimal yet sufficient number of tools, and easy to use.

This could be a good way to get into Ansible and Hacking at the same time.
